description: "Visual Studio Code has an amazing VS Code extension to use with Vitest. It makes working Vitest a wonderful experience."
---

[Please go install this extension][vitest-vscode].

This extension makes working with Vitest magical âœ¨

Some highlights:

- Every time you save a file your test suite will run so you can failures faster. (this is configurable if your tests take a long time to run.)
- A nice little visual indicator on the tests themselves that they past their last run.
- The ability to debug individual tests.
- Inline you can see test failures. You can see which test is failing and why.
- A nice test explore pane on the sidebar.
- You can update Vitest snapshots directly from a prompt in VS Code.
- You can see Vitest snapshots directly from the test code without having to navigate to them.

I'm a big fan. Now every time I work with Vitest I use it. Highly suggest installing it anytime you're near Vitest.
