Thank you for sticking through this and hopefully you feel like you really dug into a good portion of the React ecosystem. With these additional tools in your React toolbox I feel like you're ready to take on any project that you decide to tackle.

Please let me know how you liked the course and definitely [tweet at me][holtbt]! If you haven't I'd love a [star on this repo too][star].

Thanks again and I'll see you [back on Frontend Masters!][fem]!

## Next step projects

- Write good tests to get 100% coverage on the whole project
- Finish the migration from CSS to TailwindCSS
- Combine a few of the sections. Try writing tests for TypeScript, TailwindCSS server-side rendering, etc.
- Deploy your projects and tell me about it!
